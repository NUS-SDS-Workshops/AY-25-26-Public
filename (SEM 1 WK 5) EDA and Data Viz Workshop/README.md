# EDA and Data Viz Workshop

Hello all and welcome to the first workshop of the semester: "**What's your EDA?: an introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization Techniques using Python**". Please download the entire '(SEM 1 WK 5) EDA and Data Viz Workshop' folder onto your local computer ([click this link to do so](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNUS-SDS-Workshops%2FAY-25-26-Public%2Ftree%2Fmain%2F%28SEM%25201%2520WK%25205%29%2520EDA%2520and%2520Data%2520Viz%2520Workshop)). You may then extract this folder onto any directory in your computer and run the code after ensuring the following steps have been met.

## Requirements

As our Workshop will involve a Code-Along; it is recommended to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm/ VSCode installed and configured on your laptop. As this Workshop involves Python - it is also necessary to have a version of Python greater than Python 3.8 installed on your device. You will also have to check that the necessary libraries in the requirements.txt file have been installed. If you are unsure if this is the case; you may install those libraries by running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in your terminal/ command prompt.

You may also use Google Colab (free, web-based IDE) instead of a local IDE. To do so, open [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) and upload the required notebooks from the downloaded folder. Check that the necessary libraries in the requirements.txt file have been installed. If you are unsure if this is the case; you may install those libraries by running the `!pip install -r requirements.txt` command in a new cell block. Demonstration of using Colab will be conducted at the start of our workshop.

## Dataset

The datasets primarily used for the code-along are the `employee_dirty.csv` and `employee_cleaned.csv`. Please also have the `netflix_titles.csv` ready for an activity later on. Ensure that these files are located in the same folder as the code and the requirements.txt file.

## Code

The Code is setup in a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file that is pragmatic to run in Data Science and Analysis (DSA) Applications. It allows for segments of code to be run individually and also supports Markdowns (Text) and Images alongside code blocks. As the syntax is primarily similar to standard CPython files and it can be run by most IDEs that can run python files - unfamiliarity with Jupyter Notebooks is not something to be overly concerned with for the Workshop. It is recommended (especially if you are using VSCode) to install extensions that can help accentuate Jupyter Notebooks - such extensions in VSCode can be found by searching "Python" and "Jupyter" in the extensions search bar.

Should you have any queries apart from those mentioned above, do feel free to raise them before/during the Workshop segment. Thank you and happy coding!
