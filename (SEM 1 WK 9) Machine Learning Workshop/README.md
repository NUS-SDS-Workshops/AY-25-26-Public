# Introduction to Machine Learning
Hello and welcome to the second workshop of the semester: "Machines That Learn." To get started, please download the entire *(SEM 1 WK 9) Machine Learning Workshop* folder to your computer by [clicking this link](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNUS-SDS-Workshops%2FAY-25-26-Public%2Ftree%2Fmain%2F%28SEM%25201%2520WK%25209%29%2520Machine%2520Learning%2520Workshop). Once downloaded, extract the folder to any directory of your choice and follow the next steps to begin.

# Requirements
As our Workshop will involve a Code-Along; it is recommended to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm/ VSCode installed and configured on your laptop. As this Workshop involves Python - it is also necessary to have a version of Python greater than Python 3.8 installed on your device. You will also have to check that the necessary libraries in the requirements.txt file have been installed. If you are unsure if this is the case; you may install those libraries by running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in your terminal/ command prompt.

You may also use Google Colab (free, web-based IDE) instead of a local IDE. To do so, open Google Colab and upload the required notebooks from the downloaded folder. Check that the necessary libraries in the requirements.txt file have been installed. If you are unsure if this is the case; you may install those libraries by running the `!pip install -r requirements.txt` command in a new cell block. Demonstration of using Colab will be conducted at the start of our workshop.

# Dataset
The datasets primarily used for the code-along are the `weatherAUS_rainfall_prediction_dataset_cleaned.csv` and `house_selling_prices_FL.csv` for linear regression. Please also have the `Walmart_Sales.csv` ready for an activity later on. 

# Code
The Code is setup in a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file that is pragmatic to run in Data Science and Analysis (DSA) Applications. It allows for segments of code to be run individually and also supports Markdowns (Text) and Images alongside code blocks. As the syntax is primarily similar to standard CPython files and it can be run by most IDEs that can run python files - unfamiliarity with Jupyter Notebooks is not something to be overly concerned with for the Workshop. It is recommended (especially if you are using VSCode) to install extensions that can help accentuate Jupyter Notebooks - such extensions in VSCode can be found by searching "Python" and "Jupyter" in the extensions search bar.

Should you have any queries apart from those mentioned above, do feel free to raise them before/during the Workshop segment. Thank you and happy coding!
